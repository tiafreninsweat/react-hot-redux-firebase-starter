# How to Extract Xbox 360 ISOs with ExisoGUI v1.4b

These files are usually compressed with a newer format called XGD3, which requires a special tool to extract them. One of these tools is ExisoGUI v1.4b, a graphical user interface for the command-line program Exiso.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use ExisoGUI v1.4b to extract Xbox 360 ISOs and convert them to GOD (Game On Demand) format, which can be played on your console without burning them to discs. You will need the following:

If you want to learn more about ExisoGUI v1.4b and its features, you can read the readme.txt file that comes with the program. It explains the various options and settings that you can use to customize your extraction process. For example, you can choose to extract only certain files or folders from the ISO, or to split the GOD files into smaller sizes for easier transfer.
 
ExisoGUI v1.4b is not the only tool that can extract Xbox 360 ISOs. There are other programs that can do the same job, such as Xbox Image Browser or Xbox Backup Creator. However, ExisoGUI v1.4b has some advantages over them, such as being faster, more reliable, and more user-friendly. It also supports the latest XGD3 format, which some older tools may not.

However, you should always be careful when downloading games from the internet, as some of them may contain viruses or malware that can harm your PC or your console. You should also respect the copyright laws and only download games that you own legally.
