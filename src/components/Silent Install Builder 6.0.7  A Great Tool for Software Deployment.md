Silent Install Builder is not only a tool for creating installation packages, but also a tool for managing and updating them. You can easily edit, modify, or delete any package that you have created with Silent Install Builder. You can also import and export packages to share them with others or to backup them.
 
One of the main features of Silent Install Builder is the UI automation scripting. This feature allows you to record the actions and inputs that you perform during the installation of an application. The recorded script will be replayed silently during the package installation, without any user interaction. This way, you can automate the installation of applications that do not have a silent or unattended mode.
 
Silent Install Builder supports various scripting languages, such as PowerShell, CMD, VBS, JavaScript, and more. You can also use the .NET Framework API to access system resources and perform advanced operations. You can write your own scripts or use the predefined functions and install conditions that Silent Install Builder provides.
  
Another feature of Silent Install Builder is the installer type detection. This feature allows you to automatically detect the command line options for most common installers, such as MSI, EXE, NSIS, Inno Setup, and more. You can also manually specify the command line options for any installer that is not supported by Silent Install Builder.
 
Silent Install Builder can create either .exe or .msi (Windows Installer) packages. The .exe packages are self-extracting executables that can run on any Windows system without any dependencies. The .msi packages are Windows Installer packages that can be deployed using GPO, SCCM, Intune, or other software deployment tools. You can choose the package type that suits your needs and preferences.
 
Silent Install Builder is a powerful and versatile tool for software deployment. It can help you create installation packages for multiple applications at once, automate the installation process by recording an UI automation script or executing commands and scripts, and manage and update your packages easily. It can also create smart packages that are compatible with various software deployment tools and Windows versions.
