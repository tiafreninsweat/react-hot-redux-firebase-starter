## Method 1: Repair IMEI
 
One of the common causes of network error on Huawei G730-u00 is a corrupted or null IMEI. IMEI is a unique identifier for your phone that allows it to connect to the network. If your IMEI is missing or invalid, your phone will not be able to register with the network provider and you will get no service or emergency data error. To repair your IMEI, you will need a tool called SigmaKey and a USB cable. Follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install SigmaKey from [here](https://sigmakey.com/en/Downloads/Software.html).
2. Enable USB debugging on your phone by going to Settings > Developer options > USB debugging.
3. Connect your phone to the computer via USB cable and launch SigmaKey.
4. Select ADB platform and choose Huawei Android from the drop-down menu.
5. Click on Repair IMEI tab and enter your original IMEI number. You can find it on the back of your phone or on the box.
6. Click on Repair button and wait for the process to complete.
7. Reboot your phone and check if the network error is fixed.

## Method 2: Flash Stock Firmware
 
Another possible reason for network error on Huawei G730-u00 is a wrong or incompatible firmware. Firmware is the software that runs your phone and controls its functions. If you flash a firmware that is not meant for your phone model or region, you may encounter various problems, such as network error, bootloop, or dead phone. To fix this, you will need to flash the stock firmware that matches your phone's specifications. Follow these steps:

1. Download the stock firmware for Huawei G730-u00 from [here](https://www.getdroidtips.com/huawei-ascend-g730-stock-firmware/). Make sure you choose the right version for your region and carrier.
2. Extract the downloaded file and copy the dload folder to the root of your SD card.
3. Turn off your phone and insert the SD card.
4. Press and hold Volume Up + Volume Down + Power buttons simultaneously until you see the Huawei logo.
5. The phone will automatically detect the update file and start flashing it.
6. Wait for the process to finish and reboot your phone.
7. Check if the network error is fixed.

## Method 3: Check Hardware
 
If none of the above methods work, then you may have a hardware problem with your phone. Hardware problems can be caused by physical damage, water exposure, overheating, or faulty components. Some of the hardware parts that can affect your network connection are the SIM card, SIM tray, antenna, or motherboard. To check your hardware, you can try these steps:

- Clean your SIM card and SIM tray with a soft cloth and make sure they are properly inserted.
- Try using another SIM card from a different network provider and see if it works.
- Open your phone and check if there are any loose or broken connections between the antenna and the motherboard.
- If you are not confident in opening your phone or repairing it yourself, take it to a professional service center and have it diagnosed and fixed.
